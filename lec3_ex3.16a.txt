Initialize a variable last_position to n - 1, where n is the length of the array-based list a.

Start a loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = last_position.

For each element a[i], compare it with the value x that you want to remove duplicates of.

If a[i] is equal to x, then it's a duplicate, and you need to remove it. To remove it, shift all elements to the right of a[i] one position to the left to fill the gap created by removing the duplicate.

Decrement last_position by 1 since the list has become one element shorter.

Continue this process until the loop finishes, and you will have removed all duplicates of x from the list.
